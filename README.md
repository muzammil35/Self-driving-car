## Usage/Examples
```
•The Generated Cars will attempt to overcome the traffic obstacles.
•if a car makes contact with a dummy car or the side of the road it will be deleted. 
•pressing the refresh button on your browser allows you to restart a new attempt. 
•The save and discard buttons can be used to save a promising car attempt or discard a car attempt. 
•if a car attempt is saved, in the next run the network-information of the most promising car (the car that made it the furthest without being deleted) 
 will be fed into the Mutation function of the genetic algorithm to try to emulate previous success while adding in a bit of randomness to see if we can do better.
